# progress

The ledger for porting `PythonProject1` (Python) to this repo (Rust, browser, GitHub Pages).
One row per increment, appended and never rewritten — if something regresses, add a row saying so.

Plan: `~/.claude/plans/ancient-honking-biscuit.md`.
Built by `porter`, closed by `ux-walker` on the deployed page.

## Ledger

| # | Feature | Host tests | Headless | Hosted (ux-walker) | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | Dioxus shell, cross-origin isolation, deploy | 19 green | renders, `crossOriginIsolated: true`, no console errors | ⬜ pending `ux-walker` | `a650573` | Live at https://kaush4l.github.io/ASKK/. The dashboard fragment's `hx-*` panel loader is inert (htmx gone) — it shows "loading panel…" until fragments land in increment 02. |

## Parity with the Python project

The stop condition. A line ticks when the behaviour matches and a test pins it — not when the
feature "exists".

| Python | Behaviour that must match | Done |
|---|---|---|
| `core/engine.py` | ReAct turn: answer / tool call / failure exits | ⬜ |
| `core/engine.py` | Rolling window compaction, summary + retained tail | ⬜ |
| `core/engine.py` | CONTEXT block assembled fresh every request | ⬜ |
| `core/engine.py` | Log mirrors the window exactly after compaction; writes drain first | ⬜ |
| `core/state.py` | Six statuses; `turns` increments only on entry to Working | ⬜ |
| `core/state.py` | `Waiting` (entry agent) distinct from `Idle` | ⬜ |
| `core/registry.py` | One private event loop per agent; failure records the message | ⬜ |
| `core/registry.py` | Built-in agents override-able by a project agent of the same name | ⬜ |
| `core/tools.py` | Batch layout: same line concurrent, new line sequential | ⬜ |
| `core/tools.py` | Unreadable arguments refused with a repair message, never an empty call | ⬜ |
| `core/tools.py` | Sub-agent callable as an ordinary tool | ⬜ |
| `core/space.py` | One space object per name, shared across threads | ⬜ |
| `core/space.py` | Attributed notes, 20-note cap, atomic persistence | ⬜ |
| `core/space.py` | Facts render into CONTEXT; a stale value never lingers | ⬜ |
| `core/inference.py` | Model catalogue keyed by name, not a provider table | ⬜ |
| `core/utils.py` | `agent.md` frontmatter: model, temperature, engine, tools, space | ⬜ |
| `core/agents/summarizer` | Built-in summarizer compresses history | ⬜ |
| — | Chat with the main agent in the UI | ⬜ |
| — | Chat with any agent individually | ⬜ |
| — | Agents hot-reloaded from `public/agents/` | ⬜ |
| — | New agents added in the browser, persisted, exportable | ⬜ |
| — | Alpine workspace: run a command, write a file, survive a refresh | ⬜ |

Dropped deliberately (not parity failures): `core/cron.py` — no crontab in a tab. MCP subprocesses —
they are `node` inside the VM, priced after increment 10.

## Decisions

- **gh-pages root is replaced** with the new app; the old c2w page survives in history at
  `deploy 80564a2`.
- **Dioxus** replaces htmx, superseding ADR-002's transport half. The `handle(Request) -> Response`
  seam is unchanged (I4).
- **CheerpX** is the VM backend, not container2wasm — ADR-052 measured the Bochs guest at one
  interpreted thread, permanently. Amends ADR-008: cross-origin isolation is now required, via a
  header-injecting service worker.
- **One worker, two files.** A scope may have exactly one active service worker, so COI headers and
  caching cannot be two registered workers. `web/coi-sw.js` owns the header policy and installs no
  listener (it exports `withCoiHeaders`); `web/sw.js` stays the ADR-007 caching/updates worker, owns
  the single `fetch` handler, and calls it on the way out. Responsibilities stay split by file; the
  platform's one-handler limit is respected.
- **Navigations are network-first** in `sw.js` (assets stay cache-first). Trunk fingerprints the JS
  and Wasm, so a cache-first `index.html` would point at asset names that no longer exist — refresh
  is the update channel (I11), and this is what makes it actually refresh.
- **Trunk, not `dx`,** builds the app: `Trunk.toml` sets `public_url = "./"`, which keeps every
  emitted asset path relative for the `/ASKK/` subpath. `publish.sh` now builds and deploys `dist/`
  and gates on both absolute HTML URLs and an absolute service-worker registration path.
- **`ui` is a new L3 crate** (ARCHITECTURE §2/§4 updated, layering check extended): it may import
  `kernel` and `adapters_web` only, and `adapters_web::WebApp::handle` gives Dioxus the seam without
  the JSON hop. `core::handle(App, Request) -> Response` is untouched (I4).
- **gh-pages was replaced wholesale**, which also removed the unrelated `hermes/` demo that shared
  the branch. Recoverable by force-pushing `ff90b88` back to `gh-pages`.
- **Credits are owed.** CheerpX's Community License covers this use; its action point is "give
  appropriate credits", and the runtime is loaded from `cxrtnc.leaningtech.com` because self-hosting
  it requires a commercial licence.
