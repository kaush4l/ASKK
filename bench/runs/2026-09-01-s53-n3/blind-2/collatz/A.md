# collatz — transcript A

> **This pair is not blind.** Each harness names its own tools, those names

> both sides — so they identify the harness, and to a reader who knows either
> project they identify the project. Score THIS PAIR ALONE: do not try to

> blindness was worth, and the honest way to price it is to be told.

> **Criterion 1 of the rubric is withheld on this projection** and must
> not be scored. It asks about the assembled prompt, and the assembled prompt

## task

```
Write a Python script at collatz.py that prints, on a line by itself and with nothing else on it, the number of steps the Collatz sequence takes to get from 27 to 1.
A step is one application of the rule: halve an even number, or triple an odd number and add one. Reaching 1 ends the sequence.
Run the script yourself to check it before you finish.

## turn 1 — reply (1200 tokens, 35.2s, thinking)

```

```

## turn 1 — the transport refused this reply (thinking)

```
the transport: the reply ran out of tokens while the model was still thinking, so 4,665 characters of its private reasoning arrived on the answer channel
That text is not an answer and was not passed on — read as one it would have run tool calls the model was only rehearsing. Raise max tokens (currently 1,200), ask for something narrower, or set thinking to false for this model.
```

## final answer

```
(the run produced no final answer)
